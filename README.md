- Add Binary: **

- TOeplitz matrix: *simple 2 for loops the reason compared to mat[i-1][j-1] is because we will go out of bounds. Also we are chencking not equal condition because if we return true it will give true back right away and we want the entire for loop to run*

- Recursion in trees: First write the edge case where root is null then declare the ans could be bool vector anything, since u get always confused take a helper function to keep the code cleaner and pass root and ans by ref. In the helper function write the base case for recursion. Base case is the point from where you cannot go further ie cannot do anymore recursion from their you start closing the opened funvtions and can choose to either print the value on your way dowin or up. YOu tend to do it when closing the calls. For the resursive call to the helper funcitn itself pass the relevant root node could be root->left or -> right and call the helper function form the main funcitpon. Done!!!

- atoi, number to english words: Find first and last digits of a number. remember 25 to find right digit 25%10 and to find left digit 25/10, similarly 234/100 = 2 , 234%10 =
