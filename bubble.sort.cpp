/*This is used to identify whether the list is already sorted. When the list is already sorted (which is the best-case scenario), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n).
In real life, bubble sort can be visualised when people in a queue wanting to be standing in a height wise sorted manner swap their positions among themselves until everyone is standing based on increasing order of heights.*/
